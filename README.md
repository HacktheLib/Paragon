Idea: Create a game-based platform for students in grades 1-8 to be able to expand their mathematical knowledge and abilities. In this game, they can increase their in-game level by achieving at least 90% accuracy within each level. Before moving on to the next level, students have the option to explore resources we provide to aid them in the learning process for subjects they are not yet familiar with (i.e. A short guide on the basics of multiplication, YouTube links covering the fundamentals of algebra 1, etc.)  Goal: Challenge students to learn willingly rather than in a strict classroom-based setting. This will ultimately allow students to increase their problem-solving skills as well as their ability to process information. In turn, this will ultimately aid students regardless of their socioeconomic background and put them on a level playing field in the nation in terms of producing results as they prepare to move on into the post-secondary chapter of their lives.
