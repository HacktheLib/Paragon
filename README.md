Dear judges,

We hope you are all doing well especially during these difficult times. First off, we would like to thank you for volunteering your time to judge this hackathon! The name of our project is Paragon, meaning a person who is a model of excellence. We were inspired by the lack of resources in the public education system in the United States and the below global average test scores our youth produce in order to create a fun website where students can test their mathematical abilities starting from the fundamentals. We hope that our project is to your liking! 

All the best,

Team Paragon
